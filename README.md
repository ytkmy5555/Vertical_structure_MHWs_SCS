Description of the data and file structure

To maintain consistency in the identification of MHWs, the daily dataset from the NOAA OISST V2 was selected for use in this study. This dataset, acquired using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR) for remote sensing of Sea Surface Temperature (SST), has a spatial resolution of 0.25° and covers the period from 1982 to 2022  (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/optimum-interpolation-sst). The CARS2009 Climatology data was sourced from the CSIRO Atlas of Regional Seas (https://www.cmar.csiro.au/cars. The NCEP-DOE Reanalysis 2 dataset was used to acquire daily air-sea heat flux data (https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis2.html). The GLORYS12V1 mixed-layer depth data was accessed from CMEMS at https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_PHY_001_030/description to satisfy the necessary spatiotemporal resolution.
